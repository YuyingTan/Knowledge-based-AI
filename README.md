Case studies of knowledge representation and reasoning

Here I collect case studies about knowledge based AI with its reference. Note that this is only for the purpose of study. If you have problem openning the .pdf directly, please try downloading the whole zip.

## Object oriented representation 
Marvin Minsky in 1975 suggested the idea of using object oriented groups of procedures to recognize and deal with new situations. Minsky used the term frame for the data structure used to represent these situations. The procedures attached to frames give us a flexible, organized framework for computation. The whole point of object-oriented reasoning is to determine the sort of questions appropriate for a type of object and to design procedures to answer them. <br>
* EXAMPLE: USING FRAMES TO PLAN A TRIP <br>
In this example We will see how the “symbolic spreadsheet” style of reasoning in frame systems is used. This might be particularly useful in supporting the documentation one often uses in a company for reporting expenses. <br>

## Inheritance
Hierarchies allow us to avoid repeating representations—it is sufficient to say that “elephants are mammals” to immediately know a great deal about them. Taxonomies of kinds of objects are so fundamental to our thinking about the world that they are found everywhere, especially when it comes to organizing knowledge in a comprehensible form for human consumption, in encyclopedias, dictionaries, scientific classifications, and so on.<br>
Key points of this part: <br>
* strict inheritance network - directed acyclic graph (DAG)<br>
* defeasible Inheritance <br>
* strategies for defeasible inheritance: Shortest Path Heuristic; Inferential Distance; Extension (belief sets) of ambiguous networks; credulous reasoning; skeptical reasoning <br>

Inheritance networks, as described in the text, grew out of a more general-purpose representation formalism that used inheritance, known as semantic networks. Early and influential work in this area, inspired by the semantics of verbs and nouns in natural language, was done by Quillian and, for the application of computer vision, Winston. <br>
