Case studies of knowledge representation and reasoning

Here I collect case studies about knowledge based AI with its reference. Note that this is only for the purpose of study.

## Object oriented representation 
Marvin Minsky in 1975 suggested the idea of using object oriented groups of procedures to recognize and deal with new situations. Minsky used the term frame for the data structure used to represent these situations. The procedures attached to frames give us a flexible, organized framework for computation. The whole point of object-oriented reasoning is to determine the sort of questions appropriate for a type of object and to design procedures to answer them. <br>
* EXAMPLE: USING FRAMES TO PLAN A TRIP <br>
In this example We will see how the “symbolic spreadsheet” style of reasoning in frame systems is used. This might be particularly useful in supporting the documentation one often uses in a company for reporting expenses. <br>
